# Exercises
Attempts at programming problems, algorithms and concepts.

Also contains a few scratch programming exercises from different places, organised by language.

I haven't listed them by book/site in case the exercises in the book are being used for academic tests and someone can just google the solution, but I wish I could also find specific solutions to problems from books that I am self-studying. What to do?
